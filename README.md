# Principal Component Analysis
This repository looks at dimensionality reduction techniques. It contains the code to a principal component analysis and to an autoencoder, both using the wine dataset.

## Getting started
Start by cloning the Git repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lena-will/pca.git
```
## Data
I use the wine dataset from UCI's machine learning repositiry. The data and description can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine
